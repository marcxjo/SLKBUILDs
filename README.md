# SLKBUILDs
SLKBUILD scripts and accompanying patches for Salix/Slackware packages

This repository contains all the files necessary to build custom packages I have built for Salix OS; most will be compatible with Slackware as well, but note that they will require modifications to your system. (For example, although it can be made to run under e.g. Xfce, you probably won't want or need to install MintMenu unless you use the Salix repository's MATE Desktop packages or have compiled the MATE SlackBuilds packages on your own machine). Files named README.Salix are included with scripts which require special Salix-specific considerations, such as variable dependencies or particularly many patches.

Note that these packages often don't see a lot of QA outside of my own machines, so caveat emptor: your mileage may vary.
